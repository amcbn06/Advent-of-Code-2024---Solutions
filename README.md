# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This year, out of boredom, curiosity and because i thought it would be fun, I decided to try to solve all the problems from the Advent of Code.
 
Here are my solutions and some personal impressions for each problem:
- Day 1:
  - [Part 1](./solutions/day1/part1.cpp): pretty basic problem involving sortings
  - [Part 2](./solutions/day1/part2.cpp): a little bit nicer, used contribution technique and maps
- Day 2:
  - [Part 1](./solutions/day2/part1.cpp): interesting problem, pretty easy solution in O(n)
  - [Part 2](./solutions/day2/part2.cpp): initially i tried an O(n) solution by precomputing if each prefix/suffix is safe, apparently it didn't work for whatever reason so i used the same approach as part 1 and reached O(n^2) time complexity
