# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This year, out of boredom, curiosity and because i thought it would be fun, I decided to try to solve all the problems from the Advent of Code.
 
Here are my solutions and some personal impressions for each problem:
- Day 1: [Part 1](./solutions/day1/part1.cpp), [Part 2](./solutions/day1/part2.cpp)
  - pretty basic problem involving sortings for part 1 and maps for part 2
- Day 2: [Part 1](./solutions/day2/part1.cpp), [Part 2](./solutions/day2/part2.cpp)
  - solved part 1 quickly in O(n), got stuck whilte trying to solve part 2 in O(n) too, ended up using the same logic as in part 1 and reached O(n^2) time complexity
- Day 3: [Part 1](./solutions/day3/part1.cpp), [Part 2](./solutions/day3/part2.cpp)
  - a problem involving lots of parsing, i honestly hated it
- Day 4: [Part 1](./solutions/day4/part1.cpp), [Part 2](./solutions/day4/part2.cpp)
  - finally a decent problem, the solutions are pretty straightforward, just counting occurences of "XMAX" along any direction for part 1, and check for each 3x3 square if it contains an X-MAS for part 2
