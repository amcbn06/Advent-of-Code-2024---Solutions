# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This year, out of boredom, curiosity and because i thought it would be fun, I decided to try to solve all the problems from the Advent of Code.

Here are my solutions and some personal impressions for each problem:
- 01.12.2024:
  - [Part 1](solutions/01.12.2024/part1.cpp): pretty basic problem involving sortings
  - [Part 2](solutions/01.12.2024/part2.cpp): a little bit nicer, used contribution technique and maps
